    "## Motivation and Context\n",
    "Transfer learning turns out to be useful when dealing with relatively small datasets; for examples medical images, which are harder to obtain in large numbers than other datasets. Instead of training a deep neural network from scratch, which would require a significant amount of data, power and time, it's often convenient to use a pretrained model and just finetune its performance to simplify and speed up the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) be sure to check out the wikipedia page on CNNs for a more detailed description.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, convolutional networks are used on (but not only) images instead of fully-connected feedforward networks because they would require a very high number of neurons - i.e. at least one per pixel in the input layer - and that would make them inconvenient."
