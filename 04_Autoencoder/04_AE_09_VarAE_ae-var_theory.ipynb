    "To get an understanding of a VAE, we'll first start from a simple network and add parts step by step. An common way of describing a neural network is an approximation of some function we wish to model. However, they can also be thought of as a data structure that holds information.\n",

Then, we can train the network to reduce the mean squared error between itself and one target image. The \"data\" for that image is now contained within the network's parameters."
